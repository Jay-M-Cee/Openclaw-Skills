# Public and open resources for making `med-info` better

This catalog lists public APIs, open datasets, and authoritative documentation sources that can extend `med-info`.

- Goal: 100+ sources.
- Each entry should include: name, URL, what it adds, access method, license/terms note, and a suggested smoke-test URL.
