## Concise Overall Synthesis

The collected papers are complementary across three layers: formal infrastructure, evaluation methodology, and agentic workflow implementation. Infrastructure papers strengthen trust and proof reuse inside Lean 4, while benchmark papers expose realistic capability gaps in constructive tasks. Pipeline-oriented papers focus on system composition and orchestration quality. Together, they indicate that practical Lean 4 + LLM progress depends on balanced improvements in theorem infrastructure, benchmark design, and end-to-end pipeline engineering.
