## Concise Overall Synthesis

The papers cluster into architecture/alignment, training data strategy, and downstream evaluation systems. Architecture-focused work improves modality fusion and long-context grounding, while data-focused work controls robustness and generalization. Evaluation-oriented papers highlight that benchmark coverage is still uneven, especially for high-resolution documents and multi-step visual tool use. End-to-end progress depends on jointly designing model architecture, data curation, and realistic task evaluation.
