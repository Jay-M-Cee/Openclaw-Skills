## Concise Overall Synthesis

This collection shows a three-layer progression for LLM-for-math systems: foundational reasoning modules, benchmark/data construction, and execution pipelines with external tools. Strong papers combine formal verification or symbolic checks with robust search strategies. Benchmark design remains a key bottleneck because evaluation formats strongly influence apparent capability. The most promising direction is closed-loop systems that jointly optimize generation, checking, and iterative correction.
