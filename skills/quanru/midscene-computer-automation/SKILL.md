# Desktop Computer Automation

> **CRITICAL RULES — VIOLATIONS WILL BREAK THE WORKFLOW:**
>
> 1. **NEVER set `run_in_background: true`** on any Bash tool call for midscene commands. Every `npx @midscene/computer` command MUST use `run_in_background: false` (or omit the parameter entirely). Background execution causes notification spam after the task ends and breaks the screenshot-analyze-act loop.
> 2. **Send only ONE midscene CLI command per Bash tool call.** Wait for its result, read the screenshot, then decide the next action. Do NOT chain commands with `&&`, `;`, or `sleep`.
> 3. **Set `timeout: 60000`** (60 seconds) on each Bash tool call to allow sufficient time for midscene commands to complete synchronously.

Control your entire macOS desktop using `npx @midscene/computer`. Each CLI command maps directly to an MCP tool — you (the AI agent) act as the brain, deciding which actions to take based on screenshots.

## Prerequisites

The CLI automatically loads `.env` from the current working directory. Before first use, verify the `.env` file exists and contains the API key:

```bash
cat .env | grep MIDSCENE_MODEL_API_KEY | head -c 30
```

If no `.env` file or no API key, ask the user to create one. See [Model Configuration](https://midscenejs.com/zh/model-common-config.html) for supported providers.

**Do NOT run `echo $MIDSCENE_MODEL_API_KEY`** — the key is loaded from `.env` at runtime, not from shell environment.

## Commands

### Connect to Desktop

```bash
npx @midscene/computer connect
npx @midscene/computer connect --displayId <id>
```

### List Displays

```bash
npx @midscene/computer list_displays
```

### Take Screenshot

```bash
npx @midscene/computer take_screenshot
```

After taking a screenshot, read the saved image file to understand the current screen state before deciding the next action.

### Perform Actions

Use actionSpace tools to interact with the desktop:

```bash
npx @midscene/computer Tap --locate '{"prompt":"the Safari icon in the Dock"}'
npx @midscene/computer DoubleClick --locate '{"prompt":"the Documents folder"}'
npx @midscene/computer RightClick --locate '{"prompt":"the desktop background"}'
npx @midscene/computer Input --locate '{"prompt":"the search field"}' --content 'hello world'
npx @midscene/computer Scroll --direction down
npx @midscene/computer KeyboardPress --value 'Command+Space'
npx @midscene/computer DragAndDrop --locate '{"prompt":"the file icon"}' --target '{"prompt":"the Trash icon"}'
```

### Natural Language Action

Use `act` to execute multi-step operations in a single command — useful for transient UI interactions like Spotlight:

```bash
npx @midscene/computer act --prompt "press Command+Space, type Safari, press Enter"
```

### Disconnect

```bash
npx @midscene/computer disconnect
```

## Workflow Pattern

Since CLI commands are stateless between invocations, follow this pattern:

1. **Connect** to establish a session
2. **Take screenshot** to see the current state
3. **Analyze** the screenshot to decide the next action
4. **Execute action** (Tap, Input, KeyboardPress, etc.)
5. **Take screenshot** again to verify the result
6. **Repeat** steps 3-5 until the task is complete
7. **Disconnect** when done

## Best Practices

1. **Take screenshots frequently**: Before and after each action to verify state changes.
2. **Use keyboard shortcuts for reliability**: `KeyboardPress --value 'Command+C'` is often more reliable than clicking UI elements.
3. **Be specific about UI elements**: Instead of vague descriptions, provide clear, specific details. Say `"the red close button in the top-left corner of the Safari window"` instead of `"the close button"`.
4. **Describe locations when possible**: Help target elements by describing their position (e.g., `"the icon in the top-right corner of the menu bar"`, `"the third item in the left sidebar"`).
5. **Never run in background**: On every Bash tool call, either omit `run_in_background` or explicitly set it to `false`. Never set `run_in_background: true`.

### Handle Transient UI — MUST Use `act`

Each CLI command runs as a **separate process**. When a process exits, macOS returns focus to the terminal, which instantly dismisses any transient UI (Spotlight, context menus, dropdown menus, notification popups, etc.). This means **individual commands like `KeyboardPress` → `Input` will NEVER work for transient UI** — the UI disappears between commands.

**You MUST use `act` for ANY interaction that involves transient UI.** The `act` command executes all steps within a single process, keeping focus intact — just like `agent.aiAct()` in JavaScript.

- Persistent UI (app windows, Finder, Dock) is fine to interact with across separate commands with screenshots in between

**Example — Open an app via Spotlight:**

```bash
npx @midscene/computer act --prompt "press Command+Space, type Visual Studio Code, press Enter"
npx @midscene/computer take_screenshot
```

**Example — Context menu interaction:**

```bash
npx @midscene/computer act --prompt "right-click the file icon, then click Delete in the context menu"
npx @midscene/computer take_screenshot
```

**Example — Dropdown menu:**

```bash
npx @midscene/computer act --prompt "click the File menu, then click New Window"
npx @midscene/computer take_screenshot
```

## Common Patterns

### Open an Application via Spotlight

**MUST use `act`** — Spotlight dismisses when the CLI process exits, so individual commands will always fail.

```bash
npx @midscene/computer act --prompt "press Command+Space, type Visual Studio Code, press Enter"
npx @midscene/computer take_screenshot
```

### Keyboard Shortcuts

```bash
npx @midscene/computer KeyboardPress --value 'Command+C'
npx @midscene/computer KeyboardPress --value 'Command+V'
npx @midscene/computer KeyboardPress --value 'Command+Z'
npx @midscene/computer KeyboardPress --value 'Command+A'
```

### Window Management

```bash
npx @midscene/computer KeyboardPress --value 'Command+M'
npx @midscene/computer KeyboardPress --value 'Command+W'
npx @midscene/computer KeyboardPress --value 'Command+Q'
npx @midscene/computer KeyboardPress --value 'Command+Tab'
```

## Troubleshooting

### Accessibility Permission Denied
Your terminal app does not have Accessibility access:
1. Open **System Settings > Privacy & Security > Accessibility**
2. Add your terminal app and enable it
3. Restart your terminal app after granting permission

### Xcode Command Line Tools Not Found
```bash
xcode-select --install
```

### API Key Not Set
Check `.env` file contains `MIDSCENE_MODEL_API_KEY=<your-key>`.

### AI Cannot Find the Element
1. Take a screenshot to verify the element is actually visible
2. Use more specific descriptions (include color, position, surrounding text)
3. Ensure the element is not hidden behind another window
